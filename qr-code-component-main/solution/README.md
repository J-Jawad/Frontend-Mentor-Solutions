## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned
I tried using grid but the margins of the qr image were not equal. I used inspect and saw it wasnt a margin error. So i tried using flexbox which worked perfectly.

### Continued development

-alignment and layout
-writing conscise code
 **I don't know if that's the correct spelling of conscise**
